# Unexpected Build Error in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 during the build process. The error occurs when using a specific combination of features, such as image optimization and data fetching, potentially alongside experimental features or third-party libraries. 

## Bug Description

The application throws an unexpected error during the `next build` command.  The exact error message varies depending on the specific combination of features, but it generally indicates an issue with image optimization or data fetching. This makes it difficult to debug and deploy the application.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `next build`. 

Observe the error during the build process.

## Potential Causes

The root cause of this bug is likely related to a combination of factors.  Some possible causes include:

* **Conflicts between Next.js features:**  Experimental features or new features introduced in Next.js 15 might have unintended interactions.
* **Compatibility issues with third-party libraries:** Certain libraries might not be fully compatible with Next.js 15's build process.
* **Incorrect configuration:**  Problems with the `next.config.js` file, especially settings related to image optimization, could trigger the error.

## Solution

The solution typically involves identifying the specific conflict or incompatibility and making adjustments. This may require:

* **Disabling experimental features:** Try disabling experimental features in `next.config.js` one by one to isolate the problem.
* **Updating or replacing libraries:** Check for updates to third-party libraries or consider using alternatives.
* **Reviewing and adjusting configuration:** Carefully examine the `next.config.js` file and ensure all settings are correct and compatible with Next.js 15.
* **Checking Next.js documentation:** Refer to the Next.js documentation for any known issues or compatibility concerns with the specific features or libraries you're using.
